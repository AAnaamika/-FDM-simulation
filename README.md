# Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) Simulation

This project simulates **Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)** using PSpice schematics, developed during my Level 2, Term 2 coursework.

## What is FDM?

FDM is a technique that allows multiple signals to be sent simultaneously over a single channel by assigning each a different frequency. Itâ€™s widely used in telecommunications and broadcasting.

## Project Summary

- **Simulation**: I built a PSpice circuit to simulate how different signals are combined and transmitted on separate frequencies without interference.
- **Outcome**: The simulation demonstrates the successful transmission and separation of signals, a key concept in communication systems.

## Included Files

- PSpice schematics of the circuit
- Project report with design and analysis
- Presentation slides
